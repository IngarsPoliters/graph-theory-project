# Project Description
This is a program in Python to build an NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) from a regular expression. The NFA then can be used to check if the regular expression has matched any given string of text.

# Regular Expression
A regular expression (regex) is a string containing a series of characters, some of the charactrers in regex have a special meaning. For example, the special characters include ```.```, ```|```, ```*```. The meaning for these characters are as follows: 
* ```.``` To concatenate two characters together, so ```a.b``` means ```a``` followed by ```b```.
* ```|``` One OR the other, so ```a|b``` means ```a``` OR ```b```.
* ```*``` To concatenate zero or more, so ```a*``` means any number of ```a``` `s.

# Answers to follwing questions
* ### What is Regular Expression ?
Regular Expression, or regex, is extremely powerful in searching and manupulating strings. The concept of Regular Expression arose in the 1950s by an American mathematician named Stephen Cole Kleene in which he formalized the description of a regular language. A regular expression is a string containing a sequence of characters, some of these characters have a special meaning.

* ### How do regular expressions differ across implementations?

* ### Can all formal languages be encoded as regular expressions?
