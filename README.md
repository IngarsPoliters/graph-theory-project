# Project Description
This is a program in Python to build an NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) from a regular expression. The NFA then can be used to check if the regular expression has matched any given string of text.

# Instructions
**Requirements:**
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Clone the Repository:
**Open a Command-Line interface, navigate to any directory and enter:**
